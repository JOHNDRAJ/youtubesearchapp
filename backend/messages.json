Break the topic into 10-12 meaningful subtopics.\n2. For each subtopic, emit a JSON object whose keys are valid parameters for youtube.search().list(), plus a \"subtopic\" label. At minimum include:\n   - \"part\": \"snippet\"\n   - \"q\": the query string\n   - \"type\": \"video\"\n   - \"maxResults\": number of items to fetch (always 1)\n   - \"order\"\n   - \"videoDuration\"\n   - \"videoDefinition\"\n   - \"safeSearch\"\n   - \"relevanceLanguage\"\n3. Tailor each parameter value to suit the subtopic (e.g. longer durations for documentary subjects).\n4. Output a pure JSON array of these objects—no extra text.\nOne more thing to note is that I would like you to try to make the q prompts all be worded uniquely and have few similar words so that I get the largest variety."
